## Overview
+ Doth Translate is an application inspired by my previous middle school students and my favorite unit- Shakespeare! Elizabethan English is not easy to interpret, but it sure is fun to try! With the help of Doth Translate, a teacher can get students excited about diving into a working with Shakespearean texts by introducing them to popular Shakespearean quotes. With this simple application, students can work independently or together to generate quotes by theme or by Shakespearean play and use the context clues to work on an interpretation. Students can save their interpretations before they move to their next quote of choice, so that when teachers come around to check understanding, old interpretations will be viewable. 
+ Doth Translate allows a user to:
  - Choose a quote category.
  - Browse and choose quotes further broken down by play title or theme.
  - Generate quotes from narrowed down selection by the click of a button. Don't like that one? Is one too difficult or just not interesting to you. Choose another.
  - See context clues for words on hover: the definition will pop up in a tooltip allowing students to use those clues to help create their interpretations.
  - Type and save your interpretation of the quote for later use.
  - Allow students to review and edit eachother's interpretataion. Click the pencil to go back and edit a previously saved interpretation.
  - Save quotes you'd like to come back to.
  - Delete quotes that are clogging up your favorites.
  Coming Soon:
  - Go back and edit your saved quotes. (Full functionality coming soon...)

## Set-up Instructions

  + Type ```npm install``` into the command line to install all dependencies
  + Type ```npm start``` into to the command line to start the React app. A browser window will appear running a local host url

## Learning Goals
+ We also used `React Hooks` in our application which allowed us to use state without relying on a class component. We were able to 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features and work with advanced hooks like `useContext`.
+ Cypress
+ We are currently collaborating with Phish.in and hoping to merge our mobile version of the application so that Phish fans have a mobile friendly of the desktop application.
